# Data-Visualization-
Project name - Data Visualization

Intro- This code takes Excel files (xslx) of weather data and outputs a variety of graphs and plots. It will find the 20 largest droughts from the data and make a line graph of the droughts as well as histograms, scatter plots, and pie chart of the duration of the droughts.

Packages required-  import pandas as pd and import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Installation- Please create a folder in Jupyter Notebook and upload the weather data and the code into the same folder. After that depending on the name of the column "Gen MW WInd" inside the Excel file, you will replace it with either '6 Gen MW Wind' or '56 Gen MW Wind'. Once the name of the Gen MW Wind is changed inside the code, you can then run the code. Note: you can also change the number of largest droughts in the code by changing the variable 'n' to the number wanting.

Example of required input tables Ex. Kssenia's Weather Data 
Outputs: Table of 20 largest droughts, line graph of individual droughts, 4 line graphs of 5 of the droughts each graph, line graph of all 20 droughts, a pie chart of the duration of all 20 droughts, histogram of duration of drought, scatterplot of droughts.
